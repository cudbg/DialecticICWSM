Shutdown times, application launches, everything is speedy because of the SSD. It's actually faster for many tasks than pretty much any MacBook/Pro that is running a standard platter hard drive. But things like converting audio and video... the MacBook Pros will outperform the MBA because of their faster processors and ability to use more RAM. This leads to the following question: Can the MBA be used as a sole machine? My answer to this is yes, depending on your needs. It is capable of being a sole machine. But if you are someone working with video, audio, and the like, you would be wise to go with a MacBook Pro (i.e. 15\").

Sometimes, I have to bear down to get it to scroll.2) The touch screen: While this is a very \"cool\" tech feature, it falls short. The screen becomes dirty quickly. No matter how often you wash your hands, the oils in your skin are going to cloud the screen. Secondly, just like the touch pad, the screen is either over-reactive to touch or fails to react with touch. I watched all of the tutorials multiple times to ensure that I wasn't missing something. For instance, the tutorial says that in order to close an app screen, you can use the touch screen to \"drag it to the lower left corner\" and this will close the app. My daughter and myself ended up bursting into laughter after 20 minutes of \"dragging\" the screen multiple times only to have it \"pop\" back open. The \"on screen\" keyboard that pops us is awkward to use as well. Since it is \"on screen\", you certainly can't use the QWERTY method of typing. It is more of one finger point and click keyboard. You can't use two hands and type fast due to the angle of the keyboard being \"on screen\" and in front of you.3) The keyboard: Compared to the Gateway laptops that I am used to, this keyboard has very short (shallow) keys which I don't find as responsive as a taller, thicker key.
