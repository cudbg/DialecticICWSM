We couldn't pick just one vibe for our home either- we live in a city neighbhood that's tucked off the main sprawl next to a city metro park with a roaring river and a 10 acre nature preserve giving us the best mix of rural and urban amenities. We just couldn't decide between access to sushi and modern art or hiking and bird spotting!  Our family's motto is \""""Choose your own adventure!\"""" As a host, I want you to feel comfortable making that same choice- if you feel like relaxing at home, cooking some easy meals and taking some lesuriely walks, you'll find a den stocked with movies and cozy couches, a professional grade kitchen, and maps and nature guides to help you get to and enjoy the nearby walking trails around the river. If you'd rather spend your day exploring the city, we've got a primo esspresso and coffee machine along with a big airy bathroom for invigorating showers that will get you going early with a spring in your step. You'll find a variety of local eateries within walking distance and our home is just a short cheap uber or Lyft ride from the city center full of theaters, shopping, and museums. At the end of a long day, grab some drinks from the neighborhood bodega and relax on the secluded back deck- you'll hear the river flowing and maybe see some deer and fireflies.

We don't vacation often, but we do spend a significant amount of time binge-watching the latest NETFLIX shows and watching movies. Our favorite shows are HOUSE OF CARDS and SIX FEET UNDER. We love cooking meals with one another despite the fact that neither of us are elaborate chefs. We love cooking spicy meals, and we are both very openminded about trying new foods. We have a handful of small lakes nearby that are open to the public, so when it's warm enough, we like to take our canoe out. Sometimes we use the canoe to fish, and other times we just relax on the water. Andy really enjoys reading, and I like to spend time browsing the internet, catching up on the latest news. We are a laidback couple who appreciates humor, companionship, and affection. If staying in our home, one can expect friendly conversation with a respect for privacy, cleanliness, and a cozy, intimate atmosphere.",6,6,5,5,6,6,6,61,No,1,I did not find the feedback to be very helpful but it wasn't annoying.,"I love cooking, gardening, diy projects, tech, and my dog.

I'm Liam from Montclair, NJ and I currently live in Evanston, IL where I went to school. Before you stay in my place, you should get to know me a little bit. I am a huge fan of hiking and prefer travel destinations where I can spend all day trekking up and down hills and mountains. It's a great change from the prairies of Illinois. I'm a big basketball fan and like to go to NBA games in lots of different cities. I think there are only 10 arenas I haven't been to but that's constantly changing as I travel more. I also am an investor and believer in early retirement. Basically, I like to invest most of what I earn so I can spend the rest of my life traveling and enjoying new experiences! I love going to concerts and try to immerse myself in the local culture when I travel.  \tNow that you know a bit about me I should tell you my method of hosting. You can see as little or as much of me as you like. Our interactions can end as soon as I drop off the keys to my place or you can text me anytime you need something. This mirrors how I travel. Sometimes, I'm traveling for business and I'm locked into my work and prefer not to be bothered. When I travel for leisure I like to seek out advice and try to build relationships with hosts and local people.      Now that you know a little about me and what your stay could be like, I hope you decide to rent out my apartment!","Hi!

Thank you for visiting my bio and my home.
