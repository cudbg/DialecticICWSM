I would have liked more detail though.,"This is my review on the HP Elitebook 8460p. This laptop I purchased was one that I had been looking for. It has a number of quality features and also some not so quality ones that are anywhere from minor to moderate. Let's start with the shell and physical features.   The HP Elitebook 8460p is in silver tone and has a very sleek design. The size of the screen is 14.1 inches and the thickness overall is about 3/4 of an inch when the screen is shut and laptop is laying flat. I find it to be relatively light to carry around. It weighs about 7-10 lbs. It has a CD drive and 3 USB ports. It also has an ethernet port, SD card slot, and display port. The charger input is on the left side towards the back. Solid keyboard with black keys and a touchpad with an emergency mouse too. Very sporty laptop. This is definitely good for business and traveling. Now onto the internal and programming features.    This laptop came with Windows 7 Professional when I bought it. It turned on pretty quickly and in a matter of 30 seconds I was going through the processes of installing Windows. After everything was installed and a few months of usage, it's become my favorite PC to date. It has a 2.1 Ghz processor, 8 GBs of memory, and runs smoothly. After you get all the updates and some software you enjoy, it is really one of the easier laptops to use. The cons of this laptop are only that it's size and lack of side number keys is unavailable. It runs quietly and doesn't overheat. The battery life is about 2-3 hours depending on what you're doing. Very happy with this and hope to keep using it for the next 5 years until a new laptop is probably needed. I give it 4 out of 5 stars.","This is my review on the HP Elitebook 8460p.

It has beats audio which is really nice because I can adjust the audio settings on my headphones, earbuds, bluetooth speaker and laptop really nicely. It also has a touch screen which can be useful in a lot of situations nowdays. I like the fact that it's running Windows 10 rather than android ro something else. It has a backlit keyboard which is amazing at night. The track pad on it is huge and also has extra touch gestures for quick keys. The keyboard layout couldn't be better. The speakers on this computer are pretty nice but they are probably the least impressive aspect of this computer. The computer has a terrabyte of hard drive space so youll pretty much never run out and it has a i7 processor so it's really fast.

I must say this is the best laptop I have ever owned. This laptop has all the things I need and performs great. I love the 15.6"" screen which is clear and easy to view. My laptop came with Windows 8 which I wasn't sure if I liked at first but once I got used to it I love it. It is equipped with 4 GB ram, a dual core processor, and a 500 GB hard drive. It runs very fast and the hard drive storage is sufficient. The HD webcam with microphone makes it nice as I can video chat with my children who live far from me. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the volume is not very good but I added external powered speakers and now I am very satisfied. I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is planning on buying one in the near future. Its great!","I purchase a Toshiba C55D-A5381 15"" laptop this past October.

Its great!",4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,3,5,44,Yes,some knee-high socks,7,"I guess I wrote a lot specifically about negative issues, but I hadn't neglected to mention that the laptop for the most part ran fine. If you were looking for more information on specific segments, it was very helpful to let me know which ones I hadn't included.","This is the HP Envy with an Intel i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40 GHz with 16.0 RAM. It runs decently, but for an i7 I might expect more when I'm playing games. It comes with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M, which is not all that great in my opinion. When I try to run taxing games, it doesn't help. It's also confusing that the laptop's own Intel integrated graphics becomes the default over the graphics card randomly. However, for regular activity, the laptop works fine for the most part.  Here are some issues that I've run into with this laptop. The first and most important is sound. The sound for certain programs is kind of strange and I haven't found a way to fix the problem. When I use Skype and plug headphones or earphones into the laptop audio jack, there is a loud static sound over a call. Always. The sound on the laptop with plugged in audio is also REALLY loud. The maximum volume I can stand is 3 (out of 100). Much louder than the speaker is (if you hadn't plugged in audio). However, once I connected a monitor to the laptop (the monitor has an audio jack of its own) and plugged my headphones into the monitor, the sound works fine. The Skype problem disappears, and the sound levels are normal. This isn't too much of an issue for me, since I don't really move my laptop too much and it's usually connected to the monitor, but it is rather annoyed when I do have to take it somewhere.  The second issue is probably more of an issue with Windows than the laptop, but when updates are downloading the entire laptop slows down to a crawl. Not just internet-related activity (as you might expect when you're downloading a large update), but all functions like opening Microsoft Word, or switching windows, or anything like that. It's actually really annoying and makes my computer a slow brick when it's time for updates.  The last issue I had when purchasing this laptop is that I think there was a part inside that was loose. If I shook the laptop or moved it around a bit, the laptop would LAG for about 4 minutes. By lag, I mean 1 frame per second of all functions- moving the mouse, typing, sound lag, everything. So I think there's something wrong with the construction of the laptop. If I don't move it, nothing happens. I have since taken apart the laptop to clean the fan and put it back together, and the issue doesn't really happen anymore. I may have fixed the part inadvertently.  So these are the issues I've had with this laptop. It works fine for the most part, but these are the things I've had to deal with.","This is the HP Envy with an Intel i7-4700MQ CPU @ 2.40 GHz with 16.0 RAM.

The Asus Transformer T100 is a tablet that leaves out fancy features in favor of flexibility. If a tablet-laptop Windows 8 hybrid is what you\u2019re after, you can\u2019t do any better at the price.",3.5,5,5,4.5,3.5,5,5,4.53,Yes,Acer Aspire V3-572G-543S,5,There was very little feedback. Nothing that was provided influenced me to alter my review in any way.,"The Acer Aspire 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (V3-572G-543S)(hereafter V3) is a good machine for the buyer who wants to maximize the technical specifications of his or her laptop at a sub-$500 price point. The trade-off is the absence of most of the frills and quality-of-life benefits that one might otherwise like.  The V3 is billed as a ""gaming"" machine and fits the bill in a broad sense. The i5-5200U is a ULV (ultra low voltage) processor that provides a decent amount of power: 2.2Ghz speed and Intel hyper-threading technology. The dedicated Nvidia 940M graphics card is probably the lowest spec card that can justifiably be called a gaming card. With these specs, the machine can play less demanding games like MOBAs and Blizzard products, as well as mainstream games from a few years back, but isn't suitable for more graphically demanding games like, e.g. the Witcher 3 or Dragon Age Inquisition.  The 1080p screen is somewhat rare at this price point and on a screen (15.6"") of this size, and is something of a blessing and a curse. A blessing because the larger resolution is great for productivity; a curse because it's unlikely that you'll be able to run newer games at a 1080p resolution. Running them at a lower resolution on a 1080p screen will make them look slightly 'off.' The included 8GB of RAM is satisfactory.                                       These are the main specifications you're paying for when you buy this computer. You're also paying for the trade-offs. First, the machine comes with a generously large but abysmally slow 1TB 5400rpm HD, which isn't really suitable for gaming and is even on the slow side for general producitivity purposes, especially if you're used to an SSD. (You can swap out the HDD for a SSD, but it's not easy on this model. It requires complete disassembly of the machine.) The 15.6"" 1080p screen is a TN panel, typical of Acer's budget standalone panels, and has fairly poor color reproduction and bad viewing angles: don't use this unless you're sitting right in front of it! The touchpad is both finicky and a bit hard to use, and best avoided entirely in favor of a mouse or trackball. The keyboard is very responsive and comfortable, but has no lights for number, scroll and caps lock. There is also no 'physical' on/off button: it's just another key on the keyboard.                                                                    The bottom line is that this is, technology-wise, one of the best productivity/light gaming laptops at this price. Just know in advance what you're giving up to meet that price point, and whether you'd like to spend $100-200 more for superior ergonomics.","The Acer Aspire 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (V3-572G-543S)(hereafter V3) is a good machine for the buyer who wants to maximize the technical specifications of his or her laptop at a sub-$500 price point.

That's the only thing it said: be less specific, i.e. don't write as much. ","This is a review of the MSI GX740, which, at the time, was a *very* solid laptop. Of course, that time was 5 years ago - now it would not be considered particularly impressive - but it is still perfectly respectable, even now. When it came out, it could handle most new games with near-top graphics settings; now you'd probably have to go more towards the bottom, but it probably could still *run* them, especially if you added a bit of extra ram.  It has a 16:10 screen - one of the last laptops that did - so I'm not giving it up until I absolutely have to (though, sadly, it only supports 1680x1050, not 1600x1200). Its screen is also quite good quality, color-wise, as is, compared to other laptops I've tried, the internal speaker sound. Its keyboard is excellent - it includes all the keys you might want, including a full keypad, though a couple keys are in weird places (but you can rearrange them with autohotkey or equivalent) - as is the trackpad. It also includes a full range of customizeable special keys above the keyboard.  More than anything else, though, I'm happily impressed with its *longevity*. Good thing, too, since as I mentioned, its 16:10 screen is irreplaceable - this laptop has lasted the *longest* of any laptop I've had - every other laptop (I've had several Fujitsus and one HP) has started breaking down in essential and unfixable ways within about 4 years of buying it - this one is over 5 years old, and the only thing that's stopped working that I couldn't easily fix was the dvd drive (which I hardly ever use anyway).","This is a review of the MSI GX740, which, at the time, was a *very* solid laptop.

If you haven\u2019t used Windows 10, there might be some transition issues for you.  It does take some time to learn Windows 10, but once you are up to speed with the latest version from Windows, you will be able to maximize your usage of the Surface 4.  I would also say that available software is not yet there to fully take advantage of the touch screen, but keep looking around as new products seem to be available every week.   The best addition to the Surface 4 is the addition of the pen.  I use mine regularly to edit documents.  Though I have always appreciated being able to have the touch screen on the system, I truly enjoy having the ability to write on the screen legibly.  At times, the pen is easier to use than the mouse.  I also like being able to click the pen to open one note and take notes for a meeting.   You can run multiple programs at one time on the Surface without slowing down the computer.  I have yet to crash the computer, but it does get a little buggy if you do not restart it from time to time.   The biggest issue I have with the Surface relates to docking it.  I paid the extra for the docking system.  I use two monitors and at times it does not seem to work the way it is intended.  I also had to purchase an expansion because it only has one USB port.  You need more than one to be efficient particularly if you want to have a wireless mouse or keyboard.

I need to change the settings to reduce the heat without reducing performance, but for right now I am using a cooling pad while gaming. It doesn't get hot during regular use.

It has a lightning fast i7 processor that provides adequate processing ability while not eating through the battery.  It has 8gb of RAM and is expandable up to 16.  However, I've found 8gb of RAM to be plenty for most applications.  The screen resolution isn't that great, and is the biggest complaint I have for this laptop.  It only goes up to 1366x768.  However, the lack of resolution is made up by being a touch screen.  It has a built in stylus that has it's own buttons on it.  It's awesome for making art.  The battery life is exceptional as well.  It can easily get 6 to 8 hours through normal use including videos, gaming, and web browsing.  The SSD storage is kind of small at only 128gb, but it's lightning fast!  Another one of my favorite features of the laptop is the Thinkpad style touchpad.  it has the buttons ABOVE the touch pad which allow you to have your fingers on the homerow keys of the keyboard, and click the mouse buttons with your thumbs.  The left and right buttons are between the spacebar and the touchpad itself.  It's a very efficient design.  The laptop itself is very sturdy.  It has fallen a few times, and is still doing awesome.

It's got excellent specifications that have remained competitive for the past 5 years.  It has a lightning fast i7 processor that provides adequate processing ability while not eating through the battery.  It has 8gb of RAM and is expandable up to 16.  However, I've found 8gb of RAM to be plenty for most applications.  The screen resolution isn't that great, and is the biggest complaint I have for this laptop.  It only goes up to 1366x768.  However, the lack of resolution is made up by being a touch screen.  It has a built in stylus that has it's own buttons on it.  It's awesome for making art.  The battery life is exceptional as well.  It can easily get 6 to 8 hours through normal use including videos, gaming, and web browsing.  The SSD storage is kind of small at only 128gb, but it's lightning fast!  Another one of my favorite features of the laptop is the Thinkpad style touchpad.  it has the buttons ABOVE the touch pad which allow you to have your fingers on the homerow keys of the keyboard, and click the mouse buttons with your thumbs.  The left and right buttons are between the spacebar and the touchpad itself.  It's a very efficient design.  The laptop itself is very sturdy.  It has fallen a few times, and is still doing awesome.

Wipe your laptop and spend time learning Linux or use Windows 7 (drive compatibility issues here). Durability: 5/10. This laptop certainly hasn't been dropped, but it has been thrown around in my backpack. The cheap paint on it is strating to peel off and that annoys the crap on me. Speakers: not bad for a laptop.

USB ports can't handle the power draw...don't be surprised to see them constantly malfunctioning and being a rather pain in the butt. Would I recommend that you purchase this laptop? Sadly no. Laptops aren't meant to game, and you shouldn't game on the go...but if you do, go drop $5k on a good portable. I didn't have that kind of money and I paid the price.

When you need a laptop that can outperform in nearly every way MSI delivers the best gaming laptop experience I have yet to find. The laptop starts off with an i7-6700 Intel processor with quad cores. This alone is a great processor and is very quick in handling functions that would normally carry heavy CPU burdens. It states it can run at a solid 2.6GhZ but it continually runs at 3.8GhZ without over clocking I have brought it to 4.2GhZ with MSI Afterburner and over clocking it seems to still run stably.. In addition, there is 16GB ram to ensure a quick speed and a high capacity of just what this laptop can handle. Booting up is quick with a 128GB SSD that comes with Windows 10 and can be loaded with other programs for quick starts and fast speeds. While the 128GB handles programs there is an addition 1TB drive for storage of pictures, music, documents, and more. You can install programs to drive /:D as well as the main drive (128GB SSD).  While speeds are wonderful on this computer MSI was not behind in putting in a wonderful GPU (Graphics Card), we have the GTX970M which can handle 3D programming, all Adobe products, and runs most games in Ultra or Very High settings.  There is also the SteeleSeries Keyboard with programmable macros, a light up keyboard function with adjustable lighting, colors, and a beautiful full HD 17.3in screen with no reflective coat. The keyboard also comes with \u201cAnti-ghost\u201d and the LAN comes with Killer Gaming Network to tweet the internet for added speeds with certain programs. There is a total of 4USB ports all 3.0+, an HDMI connection, LAN line connection, Optical Drive (With BluRay Reader). All this in a metal casing with anti-scratch coating. To keep all this running MSI has also included an extra Fan Boost Speed technology as a button in the top right corner which accelerates the fan speeds to 100% or you can install MSI Afterburner to make a custom fan curve.  Pros The Speed is wonderfully fast Programs load instantly I love the keyboard, screen, and overall feel to the laptop. The graphics card is wonderful However, while the laptop has many great features there are some not so great ones as well. When it arrives all the drivers must be updated via MSI\u2019s website. Bios is not up to date. In addition and honestly more seriously, the graphics card runs too hot and needs the MSI fan curve or Speed Fan Boost. I try to keep my temps below 85c and Nividia suggests keeping the GTX970M below 93c.  The keyboard, with heavy usage, the paint can come off if you are not careful, it does chip.  My largest complaint is honestly Windows 10 that comes with this computer which is the Home version and does not come with GPU edit. Windows 10 also conflicts with many of the programs on the machine such as the Realtek Audio driver (must be updated to be compatible) and the best Nehmic sounds that is comes with will stop working with Windows Updates. Upgrading Nehmic to Nehmic 2.0+ will solve this problem. Also I would suggest turning off Win10 Updates through regedit.

I found it useful because it was good to hear that it was useful and that it needed no revisions.,"I'm writing about the HP TouchSmart 17 inch laptop. I'll first say that it is definitely a powerful laptop. It has Skylake I7 processor and 16 megs of DD4 ram. I have also found the touchscreen to be useful during my day to aid in productivity. It also has built in Beats sound, which I thought was more of a gimmick initially, but I was pleasantly surprised that the speakers on this laptop are the most powerful I have owned, although still not what I would consider to be great. On the negative side, the hinge on the left side broke after about 12 months. I was surprised, because I take very good care of my tech. It still works fine, but I will eventually have to get that fixed. It also has a relatively slow boot time by current standards, as it is not equipped with an SSD. It has onboard graphics, which do the job, but I would not recommend for gaming. The keyboard is good as I expect from HP, and I have had no issues with the trackpad. It has 720p resolution, and it has a dvd rw drive as well as 1 HDMI output and 3 USB 2 inputs. It does not run hot in my experience, but you will not get great battery life, usually between 2 to 3.5 hours, so best to use it near an outlet.","I'm writing about the HP TouchSmart 17 inch laptop.

That was good enough for me to know.,"I recently purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 to have as a backup to my desktop computer and also to use around the house without being tied to my computer chair. It is a convenient way to stay productive. I have always loved the ThinkPad products and felt I would like to own one and I am glad I made the purchase. \tThe laptop is built very well. These laptops are made for business and designed to withstand daily transporting and wear and tear. It is very durable and although I don't have a direct need for the ruggedness, it is good to know my laptop won't break if I drop it or knock something over onto it. The finish and feel of the laptop is very smooth and you can tell it is built well. I have owned this laptop for about 10 months and it has shown little to no wear. I can see this laptop lasting me a few years easily.     The features and specifications of the laptop are more than acceptable. I got this as an older model and there were several newer models available. The main reason for this was the price. I just wanted a decent Intel i5 machine with at least 4GB of RAM. I didn't want anything big and bulky that I couldn't carry with me and the 14\"" screen helps acheive this. Overall, the speed and processing power of this laptop has met my expectations remarkably. I have never had issues with applications freezing or lagging and have pretty much pushed this machine to its limits.      The laptop also has several nice additional features. It has a built-in microphone and camera, which most, if not all, laptops have these days. It also has great security features. The laptop has a fingerprint scanner so if you had confidential files on your computer or didn't want anyone to access it for any reason then you would be in luck. I personally have never used this feature but it's nice to know I have that option.     The chiclet-style keyboard is a pleasure to type on and I rarely find myself missing keystrokes. The keys are very wide and the keyboard isn't crammed together like you might find on many different laptops. It has two ways to use a mouse-pointer. You can use the built-in touchpad, which is what I use or you can use the traditional trackpoint that you have seen on IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad products for many years. I think it's cool to have an option to use either one and I feel the trackpoint just solidifies the ThinkPad product and gives it its own unique look.     Additionally, I find the battery life to be very positive. It will typically last me a whole day and then need a recharge at night. For me, this is more than satisfactory. The screen delivers a crisp, sharp image and I never find myself squinting to read anything.     All-in-all, I am very satisfied with my purchase. I would purchase a ThinkPad again in a heartbeat. This has been the best laptop I have ever owned and at the price I got it for is quite frankly a steal.

It simply told me my review was fine as is and capable of submission in that state. ,"Lenovo Thinkpad T530  Rating: 8.5/10  I'd like to start by saying that this laptop is absolutely a great value sporting impressive hardware including a quad core i7 CPU, 16gb RAM and a 15.6in Display all for under $600. I've had it a little under a year now and I can say the pros most definitely outweigh the cons. There are some cumbersome obstacles that are just generally common for laptops but it is more than solid.  *Pros*    -Hardware is impressive. Features all the CPU and RAM power you need to do anything from music production to light video editing. Browsing is also very responsive even on hardware intensive websites.  -Keyboard is quiet and response.   -LED Light for nighttime/dark room view of keyboard! This is one of the more useful aspects honestly. I am proficient in touch typing but I often have to go from Desktop to Laptop to Desktop and back to Laptop again on any given day. Because of that it can be jarring going from one keyboard to another. The LED light has proven very useful.  *Cons*    -Minimal extra video ""boost"". With essentially only integrated graphics and very low powered ones at that. Makes gaming nearly impossible and does not make for a great viewing experience when watching movies.   -Display does not get very bright/washed out on side view. This is somewhat expected as one of the earlier adoptions of LED Display on laptops but it is still a bit of a downer nonetheless.  -Trackpoint Center Button too sensative! With an uber responsive and great feeling trackpad, I just don't see the use for the red trackpoint joystick. It is right smack dab in the middle of the keyboard and ends up being jostled during fast typing creating errors often. I know there are many die-hard Thinkpad people out there who love it but I don't see it's purpose unless you are a huge user of CAD software.    Conclusion:  I love this laptop and it's a great value for anciliary business use as well as casual use. You can't expect it all from a laptop like you could a desktop but it's more than powerful enough for 95% of peoples general use for laptops (including myself) though, the mediocre display quality is a bit of a downer for travel when watching netflix/movies etc.","Lenovo Thinkpad T530  Rating: 8.5/10  I'd like to start by saying that this laptop is absolutely a great value sporting impressive hardware including a quad core i7 CPU, 16gb RAM and a 15.6in Display all for under $600.

At over $2000 for a decent device, not everyone will be able to afford it, but it is a long term investment that does save you money in the long run if you consider what you save on anti virus software, repair costs and owning the device for several years. The second issue is that replacement parts such as batteries and charges or AC adapters, are not cheap. Apple sells good devices but they are expensive. I would not recommend buying third party replacement parts no matter how cheap they are because they could damage your device.

About a month after I received this laptop, I had some issues with it and had to send it back, twice, within a 3 month span.  The process was easy and customer service was helpful the whole way through the process.  I was not charged a shipping fee either time I had to send it back.  Since then, I have had no problems with my laptop, unless you consider crashes from Windows 10 a couple of times an issue. In all of my previous laptops, I would notice a definite slowing down of functionality after about 3 years and I would tolerate it for another year before buying a new laptop.  None of my games or internet funtions are any slower now than when I first bought this laptop, however.  The only other possible negatives with this laptop that I can think of is that the battery charger died after two years and the fan is too loud.

In all of my previous laptops, I would notice a definite slowing down of functionality after about 3 years and I would tolerate it for another year before buying a new laptop.  None of my games or internet funtions are any slower now than when I first bought this laptop, however.  The only other possible negatives with this laptop that I can think of is that the battery charger died after two years and the fan is too loud. On the plus side, I was able to easily replace the battery charger for $25 from another company that specializes in chargers and I've never had an issue with overheating. Overall, I would purchase this laptop again and plan on sticking with MSI for my next laptop.  The value of their products versus cost greatly outweighs the above issues in my opinion.",2.5,4,5,3.5,3,4,5,44,No,n/a,6,The feedback was accurate and allowed me to write a better review. ,"I own the Asus Zenbook UX305.

A solid little computing machine, it's aluminum body hides a lot of perks that have kept it alive and running, six years after it's manufacture. For starters, there was the 6 gigabytes of RAM, that keeps the programs running at all times. It rocks an Intel dual core processor and I've only come close to clocking it a few times as I played a few videogames likee X-Com. It boasts a total of four USB Ports, which in my six years I've only ruined one of. The computer also boasts a CD/DVD-RW drive that runs smoothly and quietly. The screen, which is a 15 inch LCD screen is also phenomenally crisp and responsive, thanks to the integrated Intel HD graphics. It's been able to run Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 smoothly. My favorite feature of the laptop is the responsive keyboard and the fingerprint reader that allows me to log in without a password. If I have one complaint, however, it is the low battery life the laptop has when it comes to gaming, even with power settings running. It can go three to four hours as a word processor, but above that, you may look at an hour or less. The wi-fi card sometimes gets wonky, too, though it is easy enough to turn it on and off again. The trackpad is also a little too responsive in wanting to zoom in, which led me to buying an independent micro mouse.

I do a lot of work and studying-related tasks on it, but I also game from time to time. So I wanted a blend good business performance and good game performance. I also wanted a laptop that wouldn't break the bank. That led me to buy the DV6 laptop from HP.  The DV6 is a 15-inch laptop that is on the larger side. It has a 1366x768 display with good contrast, and a full-size keyboard with a numpad on the right. It comes stock with 4GB of memory and a 640GB hard drive. The laptop has the AMD A6-3400m APU, which is a quad core with decent business performance and integrated video. There is also a built-in fingerprint reader that you can use with Windows Hello. The latter is a bit finicky and doesn't always work.  The laptop loads up into Windows fairly quickly and has good office performance. Office, Chrome, Firefox, and other mainstream apps run at normal speed with no problems. The APU is slightly underpowered for the latest video games, but can handle most games at a modest to low resolution. It has no problem with older games from 2010 or earlier.  As far as portability, the laptop is large and somewhat heavy. It is durable, but the durability comes at some cost to weight. Battery life also could be better.

I'd recommend buying a cooler for it.  Overall a good laptop for the price, with weight and battery life being the major drawbacks. Performance in modern games is the only other drawback","The DV6 is a 15-inch laptop that is on the larger side. It has a 1366x768 display with good contrast, and a full-size keyboard with a numpad on the right. It comes stock with 4GB of memory (upgradable) and a 640GB hard drive. The laptop has the AMD A6-3400m APU, which is a quad core with decent business performance and integrated video. There is also a built-in fingerprint reader that you can use with Windows Hello. The latter is a bit finicky and doesn't always work.  The laptop loads up into Windows fairly quickly and has good office performance. Office, Chrome, Firefox, and other mainstream apps run at normal speed with no problems. The APU is slightly underpowered for the latest video games, but can handle most games at a modest to low resolution. It has no problem with older games from 2010 or earlier.  As far as portability, the laptop is large and somewhat heavy. It is durable, but the durability comes at some cost to weight. Battery life also could be better.

This purchase was mainly for entertainment purposes but has also become a work computer as well.  While I honestly prefer the power of a desktop the Omen has a moderate amount of power under the hood while having the convenience of portability. One of the biggst problems I've seen with people and laptops are that the machine don't have the processing power to meet their basic needs.  The Omen has a Intel Core i7 clocked at 2.5ghz which is only decent in my opinion. However it has the ability to boost it's speed to 3.4ghz which is desktop standard. These speeds guarantee that you can handle modern programs of any kind. Getting anything less than these speeds are a waste of time and money.  The Omen is a bit hefty (roughly 5 pounds), but it's to be expected considering the power it boasts. It's got a nice 15.6 inch screen with a back lit led keyboard for night time usage which is a big plus for me and my sensitive eyes.  The system can easily handle multi tasking. I can game, skype, and browse with no stutters of any kind and the battery life is fairly decent at just under 4 hours of continuous use. Even less if the processor is being boosted.  That being said the laptop does have one flaw which is it getting hot on the underbelly. However this is a universal problem with laptops in general. Adding a fan attachemnt with remedy this issue. Overall there is no reason not to pick up this laptop if you are in the market ($800 to $1000) as it will be a satisfying purchase.","This review is for the Hewlett-Packard Omen Gaming Laptop.

It was one of those eBay Daily Deals with free shipping, and it was discounted down from 850 dollars. So I felt pretty good about this laptop purchase before I even received it, having felt that I scored a bargain for a moderately-priced laptop. When the box was delivered and I took the laptop out of the bag, I was impressed with the chic metal casing. My last laptop had been of the cheap plastic variety, so I was probably easily impressed by the build quality of my new Dell. The screen is touch-enabled, and while that wasn't a major selling point for me, I still have fun once in a while with it for paint applications or app games. In addition, the widescreen display and resolution details are all satisfactory to me. The keyboard was a little bit of a disappointment however. It is a cheaper quality than the rest of the laptop build, and some of the keys snap out of alignment at times. I still have to snap a few of them back into place after a rigorous writing session. The other big thing for me was the graphics performance for PC gaming. I could never get higher performance games to play on my old laptop, and I really didn't expect my new Dell to be much different, considering that it wasn't a true gaming laptop. To my surprise, it performs admirably, and I can play many new games on this laptop. I can't play them at their highest settings, but I am still pleased by this performance from a moderately-priced computer. All in all, I have owned my Dell Inspiron for two solid years, and I have no complaints for what I paid. The speed and processing are enough for my daily demands in both work and entertainment. I also have a built-in webcam and microphone, which I didn't even realize when I bought it. These bonus features are great for recording a short video for friends, and I have even used it for Skype interviews and work. I wholeheartedly recommend this laptop.","I bought my Dell Inspiron on eBay for 700 dollars, discounted down from 850 dollars.

I, however, underestimated how much I like to work offline. The apps and programs on the chromebook don't function very well when the device is offline.

Instead it seemed like no matter what i wrote i would probably get the same generic response which basically told me to be more specific about the product attributes. So i think most of it was annoying and useless.

There are quite a few pros to this laptop to consider. It is extremely light and therefor is easy to take with you to every class if you're a student, or to comfortably just sit it in your lap without squashing your thighs if you are just using it at home. I think it is extremely fast as well. My husband has a Mac that he loves, and that I hate, and my Sony Vaio easily doubles it in speed. This means while he is still booting up his computer I am already on the internet, signed in, reading emails while I wait for him to catch up. Along with good speed it also has a decent amount of storage space, especially for a laptop. Speaking of my husband's horrible Mac that I loathe, I know I am not the only person in the world that gets confused trying to use one. I was relieved to find out that the Sony VAIO was so simple to use and nothing like a complicated Mac. Easy help buttons can guide you along as you are learning it and it is honestly one of the easiest to use laptops I have ever worked with. Don't even get me started on the battery life! After forgetting to turn my laptop off and then not touching it for 4 days i was surprised to see it still had over half battery life left when I finally used it! When actively using it I could could about 10 hours without needing to plug it in, which is extremely helpful when using it in a classroom full of 200 other students that all have laptops and are all trying to share the 6 outlets in the classroom. I could go on all day singing this laptops praises however I would be lying if I did not admit that there are a few negatives. Luckily, with a few relatively cheap add-ons, these negatives will go away. For example it does not have a disk drive, this is part of the reason it is so light, which can get annoying sometimes, however you can buy an external disk drive to add to the laptop and then only use it when you need it. Also, after owning this laptop for over 4 years, the battery only holds a charge for about an hour or so. But that has more to do with old age than an actual negative aspect of the laptop itself. Either replacing the battery or just keeping it plugged in and then not using it unplugged for more than an hour and a half is an easy fix for this. My final comlpaint about my Sony VAIO Pro 13 is about the keyboard. Yes, unfortunately the keys stick and it can really make typing difficult. I ended up buying an inexpensive solar powered wireless keyboard because of this problem, and it was an extremely cheap and effective fix! All in all I like this laptop and it has been with me for several years without dying or crashing on me, and with all the garbage products out there that are faulty and break as soon as you get them home, that is realy all I could ask for.","My Sony VAIO Pro 13 is a reasonably priced and laptop that is easy to use and has quite a few positive attributes.

Overall I think this is a functional laptop for being a little over four years old at the time of this review. There does not seem to be any significant drop off in performance. This laptop is used primarily for internet work and school work as I am a Masters student.  The display is one of the first things that jumps out at me. I have experience using both PC and Mac systems and this is by far the best display that I have ever used. I have since seen other displays that are better but for the age it still holds up very well to the newer models. The clarity of the screen allows for good viewing of videos and other media while being easy to use.  There has been no real dropoff in terms of performance. The 500GB HDD makes for plenty of room; it allows me the ability to download videos from iTunes to save on the computer for quick viewing without having to stream online. There is more than enough space for different documents for school and for work that I have saved on the computer.  The battery life has dropped off slightly. Although it boasts an eight-hour battery life (which it did have when it was new) the current lifespan of my MacBook without the charger is a little over 3 hours. Again not bad for the age but still lacking in terms of other, newer laptops.  Overall the usability of the OSX and the platform make this the best laptop for me. It still has enough power to handle some of the more complex projects I have for school while not having a lapse in performance.","The current laptop model that I have is an Apple MacBook Pro, the late 2012 13.3"" model. Overall I think this is a functional laptop for being a little over four years old at the time of this review. There does not seem to be any significant drop off in performance. This laptop is used primarily for internet work and school work as I am a Masters student.  The display is one of the first things that jumps out at me. I have experience using both PC and Mac systems and this is by far the best display that I have ever used. I have since seen other displays that are better but for the age it still holds up very well to the newer models. The clarity of the screen allows for good viewing of videos and other media while being easy to use.  There has been no real dropoff in terms of performance.
